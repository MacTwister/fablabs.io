      fab_labs_description: Fab labs provide widespread access to modern means for
        invention. They began as an outreach project from MIT's Center for Bits and
        Atoms (CBA), and became into a collaborative and global network. You can find
        more information about Fab Labs on the <a href='www.fabfoundation.org'>Fab
        Foundation</a> Website. The annotated photo below illustrates the facilities
        of a typical Fab Lab.
